Two pointers, just check both strings to see if one of them makes a palindrome.

# First Unique Character in a String
Remember, its a hash map, you can store count AND index.
`{ count: 1, index: 1}`.

# Palindromic Substrings
Expanding circles... O(n^3) is naive, with this we can bring back to O(n^2).
